# savePicDALSA

In a few words: Connects to Teledyne DALSA Camera and saves picture to computer directory

The project start with the need to trigger Teledyne Dalsa Genie Nano C1950IF camera and save the image on a given folder on the computer for further image procesing.

The idea was to use the example codes provided by Teledyne DALSA with the use of the Sapera LT framework.
The example GrabConsole from teledyne DALSA was modified to my needs.
The main parts are:
- Connecting to the camera
- Triggering the camera
- Saving the image in a folder

I am just starting with C# and coding in general so the code is not optmized neither clean by any means. 

Feel free to use it as you like and if I can help in anyway feel free to contact me via email (rafaelmsales27@gmail.com)

Don't forget that most of the code is provided by Teledyne DALSA.
