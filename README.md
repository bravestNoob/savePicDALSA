# savePicDALSA

In a few words: Connects to Teledyne DALSA Camera and saves picture to computer directory

The project start when the need to trigger the camera, Teledyne Dalsa Genie Nano C1950IF, and save the image on a given folder on the computer for further image procesing.

The idea was to use the example codes provided by Teledyne DALSA with the use of the Sapera LT framework.
The examples GrabConsole from teledyne DALSA was modified to my needs.
My needs were:
- Connecting to the camera
- Triggering the camera
- Save the image in a folder

I am just starting with C# and conding in general so the code is not optmized neither clean by any means. Feel free to use it as you like and if I can help in anyway feel free to contact me via email (rafaelmsales27@gmail.com)
Don't forget taht most of the code is provided by Teledyne DALSA.
